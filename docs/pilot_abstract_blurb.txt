In a 50-gene **unstable** subset (median breakpoint prevalence ≤100 kb: **0.044**; ≤1 Mb: **0.299**) vs a matched **stable** subset (**0.000/0.000**), proximity features (window dummies + 1/distance) produced meaningful contributions in **38.0%** vs **8.0%** of genes. Removing **only proximity** reduced copy-number coupling by **-0.0002** (median |Δr|) in unstable vs **-0.0005** in stable, consistent with QC (flag_bp_close **0.116** vs **0.016**). This indicates breakpoint proximity inflates CRISPR dependencies in breakpoint-dense regions and is mitigated by our reanalysis.
